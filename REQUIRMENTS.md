#Report:
- Introduction.
- Requirements.
- Software design.
    - Description of the software architecture of your system.
    - Any design patterns used.
    - Justification for the selected architecture and patterns.
    - UML diagrams should be included.
    - In the main body of the report place an overall UML diagram for the system.
        - Subsystem UML diagrams should be included as an appendix.
- Interface design.
    - Discuss the HCI (Human-computer interaction) design used.
    - Any principles behind the HCI design.
    - Any HCI considerations.
- Software engineering.
    - Any software engineering processes and principles used and adopted.
    - Development methodology used.
- Risk analysis.
    - Analysis of the risks associated with the chosen:
        - Development methodology.
        - Software engineering practices
        - Software design.
        - etc.
- Evaluation
    - Evaluation of the project
        - Strengths and weaknesses.
        - What has been learned, what could have been done better.
- Summary
- Teamwork
    - An evaluation of how well the team worked together must be provided.
- Individual contributions.
    - Each team member must submit an quantified evaluation of the contributions of all team members (including themselves).
    - This will be a global percentage (not a percentage for individual components). e.g. 16.667% each would be equal contribution.
    - If we decide on a single document, only one needs to be submitted- else you can do your own.
        - You can submit this as part of the appendix or separately.
- Individual reflections.
    - Each team member must write one side of A4 with their own reflections on the team and on their own contribution. These must all be included in the report.
- Compulsory appendix.
    - The coding standards adopted by the team.

##Test Report:
- Test plan.
- Test results.

- Main body of this document should outline:
    - The testing strategy.
    - The principles used.
    - The test results.
    - Any other relevant discussion about the testing.
    - Details of user testing undertaken.
- Appendix:
    - Test report.
    - Name of each JUnit test class.
    - Results of user testing.
- Must contain evidence of the coverage achieved by the tests.
## Note:
    - You do not need to produce a formal requirements document.
        - You still need to understand all the behaviour, being as specific as possible.
        - Essensially you still need requirements, but not to the extent of a full formal document.
