/**
 * "Await" future.
 *
 * @author Aurimas Bla≈æulionis
 *     <p>This future executes an input condition interface repeatedly until it returns {@code
 *     true}.
 *     <p>There are several ways to build an {@link AwaitFuture}. The base layer is {@link
 *     Future#awaitUntil(IAwaitFuture)}, which will call the function raw. Another way is {@link
 *     Future#awaitTimeout(float, IAwaitFuture)}, which will assertion fail, if execution fails.
 *     Preferably only use in tests. Third way is {@link Future#syncWith(Future)}, which is meant to
 *     wait until another input future completes. This is useful to sync client-server communication
 *     in tests.
 *     <p>After completion, this future will schedule the next future for execution.
